# Hi 👋 My name is Ismail Bouhiri 

### Front-End Developer

As a software developer with a passion for technology and a talent for problem-solving, I am excited to be working as a Front-end developer at an early-stage startup. My skillset includes a range of programming languages and technologies, including C, C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I am always looking for ways to improve and expand my expertise. Whether through self-study or hands-on projects, I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the field.
